DNA computing simulations for Notre Dame Fall 2024 CSE40/60932

This is a python module (set of functions) for simulations relating to DNA computing and the Adleman Experiment.
This code was run successfully on Python 3.12 (as of 12/19/2024).

In this repository are also DNA sequence example files (in .fasta format), and a network example (for the Adleman experiment).
The code/functions are modular, so feel free to test out your own inputs!
